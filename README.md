# Project Name: PiHomeDefender

## Project Overview

PiHomeDefender is an all-in-one, self-hosted home security and automation suite powered by a Raspberry Pi. It integrates physical security sensors (door, window, flood), network security (malicious site blocking, intrusion detection, secure guest Wi-Fi), and smart home device control (lights, outlets) into a single dashboard. The system turns basic wireless cameras into a personal DVR with expandable storage via an external drive, ensuring all data remains private and local. An intelligent AI co-pilot analyzes data in near real-time to detect anomalies, generate concise incident summaries, and suggest action plans. The core mission is to provide a cost-effective, privacy-focused, and user-friendly alternative to traditional home security systems.

**Mission:** To empower users with complete control over their home security and data through a self-hosted, intelligent, and user-friendly platform.

**Problem Solved:** Addressing the high cost, privacy concerns, system fragmentation, alert fatigue, and technical barriers associated with traditional and mainstream security solutions.

**Target User:** Tech-savvy homeowners and renters, DIY enthusiasts, and privacy-conscious individuals seeking a powerful, flexible, and cost-effective alternative to existing security products.

    -   DVR functionality
    -   Anomaly Detection
    -   Facial Recognition
    -   AI Co-Pilot
    -   Object Detection
    -   Natural Language Query
-   [x] **(Human Task)** Set up payment processing (if applicable: subscriptions). Configure and test the payment processing integration with Clerk Payments, including creating subscription plans and handling payment transactions.
-   [x] **(AI Task)** Build standard features: `adminDashboard`, `advancedAnalytics`, `analytics`, `auditLogging`, `blogFunctionality`, `fileStorageProcessing`, `multiTenantArchitecture`, `notifications`, `realTimeFeatures`, `scheduledTasks`, `thirdPartyAuth`, `userProfiles`. Implement the necessary features.
-   [x] **(Human Task)** Implement real-time functionality with Convex subscriptions.  Implement Convex subscriptions to enable real-time data updates for the security dashboard and other features requiring real-time data.
-   [x] **(AI Task)** Create responsive UI components based on `technical_architecture.md` specifications. Design and build responsive UI components that adapt to different screen sizes and devices.

### Phase 3: Integration & Testing (Weeks 7-8)

-   [x] **(Human Task)** Set up automated testing framework. Choose and configure a testing framework (e.g., Jest, React Testing Library) for automated testing of the application.
-   [x] **(AI Task)** Generate comprehensive test suites for all features. Generate unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests for all features of the application, covering various scenarios and edge cases.
-   [x] **(Human Task)** Implement error handling and edge case management. Implement robust error handling mechanisms and handle edge cases to ensure the application is reliable and resilient.
-   [x] **(AI Task)** Optimize database queries and implement caching strategies.  Optimize database queries for performance and efficiency, and implement caching strategies to reduce database load and improve response times.
-   [x] **(Human Task)** Configure monitoring and analytics. Set up monitoring tools (e.g., Sentry, Datadog) and analytics platforms (e.g., Google Analytics) to monitor application performance, track user behavior, and identify potential issues.

### Phase 4: Deployment & Launch (Week 9)

-   [x] **(Human Task)** Set up production environment on Vercel. Configure the production environment on Vercel, including setting up the necessary environment variables, build settings, and deployment configurations.
-   [x] **(Human Task)** Configure custom domain and SSL certificates. Configure a custom domain for the application and set up SSL certificates for secure HTTPS connections.
-   [x] **(AI Task)** Generate SEO meta tags and OpenGraph data. Generate SEO meta tags and OpenGraph data to optimize the application for search engines and social media sharing.
-   [x] **(Human Task)** Implement backup and disaster recovery procedures. Implement backup and disaster recovery procedures to ensure data integrity and application availability.
-   [x] **(Human Task)** Launch application and monitor performance metrics. Launch the application and monitor performance metrics to ensure it is running smoothly and meeting performance targets.

### Phase 5: Post-Launch Optimization (Ongoing)

-   [x] **(Human Task)** Collect user feedback and analytics data. Collect user feedback and analyze analytics data to identify areas for improvement and prioritize future development efforts.
