Okay, here's a comprehensive user story backlog for PiHomeDefender, meticulously designed for a Next.js/Convex/Vercel stack, adhering to your specifications. This document provides a solid foundation for development, covering authentication, core features, standard features, payments, and performance/UX considerations.

## Epic: User Account Management

### Story 1: User Registration and Email Verification

-   **Story**: As a new user, I want to register an account and verify my email address so that I can access the PiHomeDefender platform securely.
-   **Acceptance Criteria**:
    *   A registration form is available on the `/register` page.
    *   The form collects email, password, and any other required fields (e.g., name).
    *   Password must meet complexity requirements (e.g., minimum length, special characters).
    *   Upon successful registration, the user receives a verification email.
    *   The verification email contains a unique, time-limited verification link.
    *   Clicking the verification link activates the user's account.
    *   If the verification link is invalid or expired, the user is directed to a resend verification page.
    *   Error messages are displayed clearly if registration fails (e.g., email already in use, invalid password).
-   **Next.js Implementation Notes**:
    *   `/register` page uses a form component (e.g., using `react-hook-form` or similar) to handle user input.
    *   Use Clerk's built-in registration and email verification features.
    *   Implement a custom error handling component to display error messages.
    *   Consider using server-side rendering (SSR) for the `/register` page for better SEO and initial load performance.
-   **Convex Requirements**:
    *   No direct Convex interaction for registration and email verification, as this is handled by Clerk.
    *   Consider storing user preferences or additional data within Convex after successful account verification (e.g., user settings, device preferences) - this is a future consideration.
-   **Priority**: Must-have
-   **Effort Estimate**: M
-   **Dependencies**: Clerk integration setup.
